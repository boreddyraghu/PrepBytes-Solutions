Rotate Doubly List
After solving quite a few problem of singly linked list, you must be quite confident with it. Lets proceed ahead to solve a question from Doubly Linked List.

The question is simple but I am not sure of simplicity of the solution though. 

You are given a doubly linked list of size N and an integer K, your task is to rotate the doubly linked list anti-clock wise by K positions.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, number of test cases. Then follows T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains 
K and N. The second line contains N space-separated positive integers denoting elements of the list.

Output Format
The output contains T lines, each line containing the modified list.

Example
Input
2
7  3
9 8 7 6 5 4 3
4 3
10 20 30 40

Output
6 5 4 3 9 8 7
40 10 20 30
