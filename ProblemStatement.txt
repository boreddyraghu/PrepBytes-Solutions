The best way to master Linked list is to start with basics. Let's solve one such basic question. Given a linked list you have to print the middle element. Finding a middle element in an array is a matter of accessing an element using its index but in this case, you might have to do some linked list traversal. 

If number of elements in the list is odd then print the only mid element, else in case of even number of elements print the second mid element.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T, number of test cases. Then follows 
T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains 
N, size of the list. The second line contains 
N space-separated positive integers denoting elements of the list.

Output Format
The output contains 
T
 lines, each line contains the mid element.
