Last to Front
Many Linked List problems are about manipulating links between the nodes, better you understand the links easier it becomes for you to solve Linked List problems. Keeping that in mind, you are given a linked list containing N elements, your task is to bring the last node to the front. If your list looks something like this HEAD->1->2->3->4->NULL you have to transform it to HEAD->4->3->2->1->NULL

Input Format

T, no of test cases. Then follows 
T test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains 
N, size of the list. The second line contains 
N space-separated positive integers denoting elements of the list

Output Format
The output contains 
T
 lines, each line containing the modified list.
